PROJECT INTRODUCTION
I want to make a fitness app. 
The app will first take information from the user like name, age, gender, height and weight.
After, the user completes entering the information , the app will determine the requirements of the user
and plan a proper workout for the user .
The app will ask from the user the correct time he or she wants to exercise and remind the user on that time and days.
The app will also remind the user to drink proper amount of water and will ask the user to input each time 
he or she has a glass of water to keep  a track of water intake.
